# Visualization of Case Studies
## Python Scripts
Python scripts in _/src/_ are used to output Figure 7 in the paper and Figure S10-Figure S19 in the supplementary materials.
The python scripts are named as ''{sce}_{case id}_{group}_plot.py'', e.g., _MA_0_1_plot.py_. The {sce} refers to the scenario where the case is from. The {case id} is the index of the testing case for visualization. And the {group} can be '1' or '2': '1' is for CL tasks 2, 3, 4, 5 and '2' is for CL tasks 5, 6, 7, 8.

## Visulization
Run the abovementioned python files to visulize the test cases.

The output figures will be saved in _/src/outputs/_.
